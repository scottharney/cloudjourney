<p align="left">
Well, not entirely anyway. It's also very much about people and process. It is a
different consumption model for IT resources. It is much more aligned with
applications than traditional IT which may not have deep awareness of business
apps running on infrastructure 
</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
As an infrastructure admin I often only knew apps by their names with little
understanding of their function, use or role within the business.

The technology world is <b>not</b> leaving you behind.  There is a very high rate of
change and some of these "new" technologies may or may not become relevant to
your career and your business. 
</p>

<p align="left">
So you should be running towards what I'm describing as Cloud IT technologies
and methods and getting familiar with them now.

What should the IT practitioner start doing to prepare for a transition to Cloud
IT? 
</p>

</section>
<section id="slide-orgheadline15" data-background="./asg_slide_bg.png" data-background-transition="slide">
<h3 id="orgheadline15">Get a Cloud Account</h3>
<p align="left">
Get an AWS, Azure, or GCP account. They all have very low cost and/or free tiers
of usage. Start with the basic infrastructure elements.
</p>

<p align="left">
When you get your first bill, start to look at how items are charged and begin to
understand <i>why</i> some things are charged more than others.
</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
taking snaps of block (EBS) volumes on AWS can overrun the free tier. Why?
because that's more expensive storage.  So is that the best way to refresh a
machine from an image?  or should you provisoin and rebuild in an automated
fashion.  depends on use case and needs

to collaborate with others. Understand the value of cheap branching and
simultaneous work with multiple teammates.

These are all examples of declarative syntax based systems. This is a bit
different than the imperative approach of typical scripting.  the later is
valuable and can get you some time back but it's super specific.  it's the
difference between making a sandwatch and ordering one be made at the drive
through (API call).  this is a fundamental concept in cloud IT
