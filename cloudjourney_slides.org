It's always about the business

What ways do IT functions support the business

** 3 ways
:PROPERTIES:

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Help make $
- Save $
- Prevent loss of $
  
#+ATTR_HTML: :align left
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (grow)
The problem is it spends 90% of its time on the latter two bullets. Traditional
IT is focused on safety and saving money on scarce IT resources

* Cloud IT is About Going Faster 
:PROPERTIES: 
:reveal_background: ./asg_slide_bg.png
:reveal_background_trans: slide
:END:


#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Faster is a competitive advantage for many business 
- Ability to pivot
- Flexibility to experiment
- BUs can buy what they need and use immediately  
- Still can be just as safe if not more so 

* Cloud is /Not/ a technology
:PROPERTIES:

:reveal_background_trans: slide
:END:

#+ATTR_HTML: :align left
Well, not entirely anyway. It's also very much about people and process. It is a
different consumption model for IT resources. It is much more aligned with
applications than traditional IT which may not have deep awareness of business
apps running on infrastructure 

#+BEGIN_NOTES
As an infrastructure admin I often only knew apps by their names with little
understanding of their function, use or role within the business.

* Cloud Economics are Different
:PROPERTIES: 
:reveal_background: ./asg_slide_bg.png
:reveal_background_trans: slide
:END:

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Rent vs buy for public 
- Abundant resources vs limited 
- Does not reward traditional it app architectures
- Can be hard/pricey to move data out of cloud or across vendors 

  
#+BEGIN_NOTES
you are probably not going to save $ vs Colo for traditional it)

lesson : it's your data. It really matters. Should I archive to the azure or
glacier because it's cheap or "free"? Answer : maybe...

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)

The technology world is *not* leaving you behind.  There is a very high rate of
change and some of these "new" technologies may or may not become relevant to
your career and your business. 

#+ATTR_HTML: :align left
So you should be running towards what I'm describing as Cloud IT technologies
and methods and getting familiar with them now.

:PROPERTIES: 
:reveal_background: ./asg_slide_bg.png

:END:

What should the IT practitioner start doing to prepare for a transition to Cloud
IT? 

** Get a Cloud Account
:PROPERTIES: 
:reveal_background: ./asg_slide_bg.png
:reveal_background_trans: slide
:END:

#+ATTR_HTML: :align left
Get an AWS, Azure, or GCP account. They all have very low cost and/or free tiers
of usage. Start with the basic infrastructure elements.

#+ATTR_HTML: :align left
When you get your first bill, start to look at how items are charge and begin to
understand /why/ some things are charged more than others.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
taking snaps of block (EBS) volumes on AWS can overrun the free tier. Why?
because that's more expensive storage.  So is that the best way to refresh a
machine from an image?  or should you provisoin and rebuild in an automated
fashion.  depends on use case and needs
#+END_NOTES
 
** Learn Linux
:PROPERTIES: 
:reveal_background: ./asg_slide_bg.png
:reveal_background_trans: slide
:END:

#+ATTR_HTML: :align left
Cloud native and Linux go hand in hand.  it's time now to start focusing your
attention on Linux skills.  

** Learn ~git~
:PROPERTIES: 
:reveal_background: ./asg_slide_bg.png
:reveal_background_trans: slide
:END:

#+ATTR_HTML: :align left
essential skills today for the practitioner. Learn how ~git~ workflows and how
to collaborate with others. Understant the value of cheap branching and
simultaneous work with multiple teammates.

#+ATTR_HTML: :align left
There are numerous web based resources.  Reach out to me and I'll point you to some.

long game

- Chef
- Puppet
- Ansible
- Salt

#+BEGIN_NOTES
These are all examples of declarative syntax based systems. This is a bit
different than the imperative approach of typical scripting.  the later is
valuable and can get you some time back but it's super specific.  it's the
difference between making a sandwatch and ordering one be made at the drive
through (API call).  this is a fundamental concept in cloud IT
verbally mention powershell and python

:reveal_background_trans: slide
:END:

#+ATTR_HTML: :align left
Get IT and business leaderstalking. Understand what they want out if it and how they

around IT, that's an important signal.

+ Recognize that processes may have to change
+ And incentives
+ Make better risk calculations

#+BEGIN_NOTES
people need space to work. Send them to educational events that aren't the same.
Get them to report back to the team what they learned.  

This is cultural change.  you can quash it or you can give it room to grow.  

incentives may need realignment and you need to better understand what risks are
worth taking.  Are you rewarding the status quo and minimal change via your policies?
